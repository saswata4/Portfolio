**About** 

Hi, I'm Saswata! I hold a Master's in Biotechnology and Medical Engineering, with a strong passion for translational research. Currently, I am working as a Junior Research Fellow at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay. My experience spans the domains of biomaterials, tissue engineering, nanobiotechnology, and bioremediation. I am proficient in stem cell, mammalian cell, and microbial cell cultures, cell-based assays, biomaterial fabrication, and material characterization. I am eager to leverage my skills and contribute to advancing healthcare research.
