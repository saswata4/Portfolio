**About** 

I am currently working as a Junior Research Fellow at the Department of Metallurgical Engineering and Materials Science, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay. I have recently completed my Master of Technology from the Department of Biotechnology and Medical Engineering, National Institute of Technology Rourkela. I have experience in biomaterials, tissue engineering, and nanobiotechnology. I am skilled in mammalian and microbial cell cultures, scaffold fabrication techniques, cell-based assays, and material characterization. I am enthusiastic to gain more knowledge and experience in biomedical engineering and conducting translational research.
